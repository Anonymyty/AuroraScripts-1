To install it just copy the SkinDownloader folder 
to Game:\User\Scripts\Utility on your Xbox 360 and it
will be shown on the Aurora's scripts menu.
If you can't find that directory, search for
the Aurora installation wherever you have it.

If you are a developer or if simply want to contribute 
go to the website above and follow the instructions to
upload a skin.

Hope you enjoy it! :D
